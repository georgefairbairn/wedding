        <p class="mt-4 text-white">
          Saturday 21st June, 2025. The ceremony starts at 1pm, so please arrive

      <Q question="Will the ceremony/reception be indoors or outdoors?">
        <p class="mt-4 text-white">
          Weâ€™re hoping to spend as much time outside for the wedding, so both
          the ceremony, reception and dinner will all be outside. If it rains we
          have covered options, but will still be outside for most of the day so
          please dress according to the weather that day!

        <p class="mt-4 text-white">
          Ladies: think summer dresses, two pieces, jumpsuits. Weâ€™ll be on the
          lawn for the drinks reception so think carefully about heels! If
